This mini project is based on Java and employs OOPS concepts like inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism and encapsulation.

There are 2 text files named as Phase-1 and Phase-2. These text files have different items(name and weight) which needs to sent to Mars by 
sending rockets to Mars.We are given two different types of rocket U1 and U2 respectively.

U1 specifiaction
Rocket cost = $100 Million
Rocket weight = 10 Tonnes
Max weight (with cargo) = 18 Tonnes
Chance of launch explosion = 5% * (cargo carried / cargo limit)
Chance of landing crash = 1% * (cargo carried / cargo limit)

U2 specifications
Rocket cost = $120 Million
Rocket weight = 18 Tonnes
Max weight (with cargo) = 29 Tonnes
Chance of launch explosion = 4% * (cargo carried / cargo limit)
Chance of landing crash = 8% * (cargo carried / cargo limit)

Task was to perform a simulation on these rockets. First we need to load the items on U1 from both Phase 1 and Phase 2, and then simulate
its launch based on the probabilities given above. Then to perform the same for U2. Lastly we need to predict the budget of this Mars 
mission.
